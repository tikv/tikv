##    e.g.: 78_000 = "1.3m"

## File to store slow logs.
## If "log-file" is set, but this is not set, the slow logs will be appeneded

## Use abort when TiKV panic. By default TiKV will use _exit() on panic, in that case

## Memory usage limit for the TiKV instance. Generally it's unnecessary to configure it
## explicitly, in which case it will be set to 75% of total available system memory.
## Considering the behavior of `block-cache.capacity`, it means 25% memory is reserved for
## OS page cache.
##
## It's still unnecessary to configure it for deploying multiple TiKV nodes on a single
## physical machine. It will be calculated as `5/3 * block-cache.capacity`.
##
## For different system memory capacity, the default memory quota will be:
## * system=8G    block-cache=3.6G    memory-usage-limit=6G   page-cache=2G.
## * system=16G   block-cache=7.2G    memory-usage-limit=12G  page-cache=4G
## * system=32G   block-cache=14.4G   memory-usage-limit=24G  page-cache=8G
##
## So how can `memory-usage-limit` influence TiKV? When a TiKV's memory usage almost reaches

[storage.block-cache]
## Whether to create a shared block cache for all RocksDB column families.
##
## Block cache is used by RocksDB to cache uncompressed blocks. Big block cache can speed up read.
## It is recommended to turn on shared block cache. Since only the total cache size need to be

[storage.flow-control]
## Flow controller is used to throttle the write rate at scheduler level, aiming

## Limit the disk IO of compaction and flush.
## Compaction and flush can cause terrible spikes if they exceed a certain threshold. Consider

## 1. rate-bytes-per-sec is the only parameter you want to set most of the time. It controls the

## 2. rate-limiter-refill-period controls how often IO tokens are refilled. Smaller value will flatten
##    IO bursts while introducing more CPU overhead.
## 3. rate-limiter-mode indicates which types of operations count against the limit.
##    "read-only"

## Compression method (if any) is used to compress a block.
##   no:     kNoCompression
##   snappy: kSnappyCompression
##   zlib:   kZlibCompression

##   lz4:    kLZ4Compression
##   lz4hc:  kLZ4HCCompression
##   zstd:   kZSTD
## `lz4` is a compression algorithm with moderate speed and compression ratio. The compression
## ratio of `zlib` is high. It is friendly to the storage space, but its compression speed is
## slow. This compression occupies many CPU resources.

## Per level compression.
## This config should be chosen carefully according to CPU and I/O resources. For example, if you
## use the compression mode of "no:no:lz4:lz4:lz4:zstd:zstd" and find much I/O pressure of the
## system (run the `iostat` command to find %util lasts 100%, or run the `top` command to find many
## iowaits) when writing (importing) a lot of data while the CPU resources are adequate, you can
## compress level-0 and level-1 and exchange CPU resources for I/O resources. If you use the
## compression mode of "no:no:lz4:lz4:lz4:zstd:zstd" and you find the I/O pressure of the system is
## not big when writing a lot of data, but CPU resources are inadequate. Then run the `top` command
## and choose the `-H` option. If you find a lot of bg threads (namely the compression thread of
## RocksDB) are running, you can exchange I/O resources for CPU resources and change the compression
## mode to "no:no:no:lz4:lz4:zstd:zstd". In a word, it aims at making full use of the existing
## resources of the system and improving TiKV performance in terms of the current resources.
# compression-per-level = ["no", "no", "lz4", "lz4", "lz4", "zstd", "zstd"]

## Set zstd compression for the bottommost level.
## This config overrides compression-per-level. It use zstd for bottommost level to ensure
## consistent compression ratio, regardless of overall data size. If explicitly setting compression type
## for the bottommost level is not desired, "disable" should be used.
# bottommost-level-compression = "zstd"

## The data block size. RocksDB compresses data based on the unit of block.
## Similar to page in other databases, block is the smallest unit cached in block-cache. Note that
## the block size specified here corresponds to uncompressed data.
# block-size = "64KB"

## If you're doing point lookups you definitely want to turn bloom filters on. We use bloom filters
## to avoid unnecessary disk reads. Default bits_per_key is 10, which yields ~1% false positive
## rate. Larger `bloom-filter-bits-per-key` values will reduce false positive rate, but increase
## memory usage and space amplification.
# bloom-filter-bits-per-key = 10

## `false` means one SST file one bloom filter, `true` means every block has a corresponding bloom
## filter.
# block-based-bloom-filter = false

# level0-file-num-compaction-trigger = 4

## Soft limit on number of level-0 files.
## When the number of SST files of level-0 reaches the limit of `level0-slowdown-writes-trigger`,
## RocksDB tries to slow down the write operation, because too many SST files of level-0 can cause
## higher read pressure of RocksDB.
# level0-slowdown-writes-trigger = 20

## Maximum number of level-0 files.
## When the number of SST files of level-0 reaches the limit of `level0-stop-writes-trigger`,
## RocksDB stalls the new write operation.
# level0-stop-writes-trigger = 36

## Amount of data to build up in memory (backed by an unsorted log on disk) before converting to a
## sorted on-disk file. It is the RocksDB MemTable size.
# write-buffer-size = "128MB"

## The maximum number of the MemTables. The data written into RocksDB is first recorded in the WAL
## log, and then inserted into MemTables. When the MemTable reaches the size limit of
## `write-buffer-size`, it turns into read only and generates a new MemTable receiving new write
## operations. The flush threads of RocksDB will flush the read only MemTable to the disks to become
## an SST file of level0. `max-background-flushes` controls the maximum number of flush threads.
## When the flush threads are busy, resulting in the number of the MemTables waiting to be flushed
## to the disks reaching the limit of `max-write-buffer-number`, RocksDB stalls the new operation.
## "Stall" is a flow control mechanism of RocksDB. When importing data, you can set the
## `max-write-buffer-number` value higher, like 10.
# max-write-buffer-number = 5

## The minimum number of write buffers that will be merged together before writing to storage.
# min-write-buffer-number-to-merge = 1

## Control maximum total data size for base level (level 1).
## When the level-1 data size reaches the limit value of `max-bytes-for-level-base`, the SST files
## of level-1 and their overlap SST files of level-2 will be compacted. The golden rule: the first
## reference principle of setting `max-bytes-for-level-base` is guaranteeing that the
## `max-bytes-for-level-base` value is roughly equal to the data volume of level-0. Thus
## unnecessary compaction is reduced. For example, if the compression mode is
## "no:no:lz4:lz4:lz4:lz4:lz4", the `max-bytes-for-level-base` value can be `write-buffer-size * 4`,
## because there is no compression of level-0 and level-1 and the trigger condition of compaction
## for level-0 is that the number of the SST files reaches 4 (the default value). When both level-0
## and level-1 adopt compaction, it is necessary to analyze RocksDB logs to know the size of an SST
## file compressed from a MemTable. For example, if the file size is 32MB, the proposed value of
## `max-bytes-for-level-base` is 32MB * 4 = 128MB.
# max-bytes-for-level-base = "512MB"

## Target file size for compaction.
## The SST file size of level-0 is influenced by the compaction algorithm of `write-buffer-size`
## and level0. `target-file-size-base` is used to control the size of a single SST file of level1 to
## level6.
# target-file-size-base = "8MB"

## Max bytes for `compaction.max_compaction_bytes`.
## If it's necessary to enlarge value of this entry, it's better to also enlarge `reserve-space`
## in `storage` to ensure that a restarted TiKV instance can perform compactions successfully.
# max-compaction-bytes = "2GB"

## There are four different compaction priorities.
## "by-compensated-size"
## "oldest-largest-seq-first"
## "oldest-smallest-seq-first"

## while using `Raw` mode.
# optimize-filters-for-hits = true

## Enable compaction guard, which is an optimization to split SST files at TiKV region boundaries.
## The optimization can help reduce compaction IO, and allow us to use larger SST file size
