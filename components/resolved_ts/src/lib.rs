//! Resolved TS is a timestamp that represents the lower bonud of incoming Commit TS
//  and the upper bound of outgoing Commit TS.
//! Through this timestamp we can get a consistent view in the transaction level.
//!
//! To maintain a correct Resolved TS, these premises must be satisfied:
//!   1. Tracing all locks in the region, use the minimal Start TS as Resolved TS.
//!   2. If there is not any lock, use the latest timestamp as Resolved TS.
//!   3. Resolved TS must be advanced by the region leader after it has applied on its term.
