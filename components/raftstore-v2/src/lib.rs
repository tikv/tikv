//! Raftstore is the place where we implement multi-raft.
//!
//! The thread module of raftstore is batch-system, more check
//! components/batch-system. All state machines are defined in [`fsm`] module.
//! Everything that wrapping raft is implemented in [`raft`] module. And the
//! commands, including split/merge/confchange/read/write, are implemented in
//! [`operation`] module. All state machines are expected to communicate with
//! messages. They are defined in [`router`] module.

// You may get confused about the peer, or other structs like apply, in fsm and
// peer in raft module. The guideline is that if any field doesn't depend on
// the details of batch system, then it should be defined for peer in raft
// module.
//
// If we change to other concurrent programming solution, we can easily just
// change the peer in fsm.
//
// Any accessors should be defined in the file where the struct is defined.
// Functionalities like read, write, etc should be implemented in [`operation`]
// using a standalone modules.
