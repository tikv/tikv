//! Implementation of engine_traits for RaftEngine
//!
//! This is a work-in-progress attempt to abstract all the features needed by
//! TiKV to persist its data.
//!
//! The module structure here mirrors that in engine_traits where possible.
//!
//! Because there are so many similarly named types across the TiKV codebase,
//! and so much "import renaming", this crate consistently explicitly names type
//! that implement a trait as `RocksTraitname`, to avoid the need for import
//! renaming and make it obvious what type any particular module is working with.
//!
//! Please read the engine_trait crate docs before hacking.
