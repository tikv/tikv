This crate provides the types [`SkipMap`] and [`SkipSet`].
These data structures provide an interface similar to `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`,
respectively, except they support safe concurrent access across multiple threads.

This crate can be used in `no_std` environments that implement `alloc`. The `alloc` feature of this crate needs to be enabled in `no_std` environments.

[`SkipMap`]: https://docs.rs/crossbeam-skiplist/latest/crossbeam_skiplist/struct.SkipMap.html
[`SkipSet`]: https://docs.rs/crossbeam-skiplist/latest/crossbeam_skiplist/struct.SkipSet.html

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
crossbeam-skiplist = "0.1"
```

## Compatibility

Crossbeam Skiplist supports stable Rust releases going back at least six months,
and every time the minimum supported Rust version is increased, a new minor
version is released. Currently, the minimum supported Rust version is 1.61.
