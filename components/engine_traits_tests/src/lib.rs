//! Tests for the `engine_traits` crate
//!
//! These are basic tests that can be used to verify the conformance of
//! engines that implement the traits in the `engine_traits` crate.
//!
//! All engine instances are constructed through the `engine_test` crate,
//! so individual engines can be tested by setting that crate's feature flags.
//!
//! e.g. to test the `engine_panic` crate
//!
//! ```no_test
//! cargo test -p engine_traits_tests --no-default-features --features=protobuf-codec,test-engines-panic
//! ```
//!
//! As of now this mostly tests the essential features of
//!
//! - point get / delete
//! - range deletes
//! - snapshots
//! - write batches
//! - iterators
//!
//! It is intended though to cover essentially all features of storage engines.
//!
//! It is poor at testing data consistency and error recovery,
//! as such tests require hooks into the engine which are not
//! presented by the engine traits.
//!
//! Note that in some cases there are multiple ways to accomplish the same
//! thing. In particular, engines have methods that operate on the default
//! column family, and these are effectively the same as using the `_cf` methods
//! with `CF_DEFAULT`; and writing can be performed directly through the engine,
//! or through write batches. As such, some tests are parameterized over
//! multiple APIs. This is particularly true of the `scenario_writes` module,
//! which contains much of the basic writing tests, and the `iterator` module.
